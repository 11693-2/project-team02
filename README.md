### Building a Pipeline for Biomedical Question Answering


* This is a **biomedical question answering system**, which is also a team project of 11693/11791 **Software Methos of Biotechnology/Design and Engineering of Intelligent Information System** at Carnegie Mellon University, Fall 2014.
* Our five team members are all graduate students at **Language Technologies Institute, Carnegie Mellon University**.
* We are trying to answer **YES/NO** questions in biomedical domain with high precision.
* Our system is based on **Apache UIMA** structure, employing **GoPubMed** as web service for query, employing Lingpipe as **Name Entity Recognizer** to identify the terms.
